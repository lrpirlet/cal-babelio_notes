Important:
  the presence of a valid nsfr_id excludes any other choice and goes directly to the corresponding page of the volume. This is THE way to bypass all choices by indicating
    as id: nsfr_id:vl$xxx where xxx is the number, positive or negative, of the page of the desired volume.
  the presence of a valid isbn, in the absence of an nsfr_id, goes directly to the corresponding page of the book, the choices made will be taken into consideration.
  the absence of a valid nsfr_id or a valid isbn implies that both the author and the title are almost correct.
    The author must be of the form: "first name last name" or "last name, first name" (note the comma in the latter case)...
    A maximum is made to take into account a slight mistake in the spelling of the author as well as that of the title.
      In particular, case and/or accents are not taken into account.

To use this plugin efficiently:
  select the book(s)
  edit the metadata (right click)
    In this window activate the "screwdriver and spanner" icon next to upload metadata
      In the configuration window
        uncheck all sources except noosfere DB (not necessary but useful especially at the beginning)
        click on noosfere DB
        activate "configure the selected source".
        metadata fields to upload: check all
          Add collection and its order number to the editor field: (see LIS-MOI editeur_collection_seriel-code)
          Log verbosity from 0 to 7: 7 minimum to create a report in case of malfunction
          Sorting priority: see below choice of volume.
          Imposes an editor: the selection algorithm is only done with this editor (exact match)
          Adds 'Prizes obtained' and 'Prizes obtained by texts' to the table of contents: check to add this information
          Adds 'Cited' in the following thematic pages: check to add this information
          Adds Cited in the following thematic lists of works: check to add this information
          Adds Citation in the Reading Tips: check to add this information
          Add Adaptations (cinema, television, comics, theatre, radio, video games...): tick to add this information

 Note
"Restore defaults" is inactive and depends on calibre rather than the plugin

          Save or Cancel to return to the previous window
        Cancel or Apply to exit the configuration and return to the upload window
      Upload the metadata
      click "ok" (even if the data, or the coverage, correspond to another volume...)
      You exit the plugin...

  you are at the first level of the caliber, the links can be followed in the "book details" (to be chosen by "page layout")
  If another volume is desired, click on "Other edition" to see all volumes, on a link under "other edition" for a particular edition
  follow the links in noosfere to the desired edition, find in the page address and copy the number (positive or negative) associated with book number.
  select the book whose metadata you are looking for, "Edit metadata (one book at a time)".
  In the Ids field, replace nsfr_id:<anything> with nsfr_id:vl$<paste the number copied here>.
   example: nsfr_id:bk$1617$vl$2146558555 becomes nsfr_id:vl$2146597675

Choice of volume:
volume choice is determined by a series of factors... "sort priority" influences the choice but does not determine it.
"imposes a publisher" limits the choice algorithm to the publisher as long as the imposed publisher is an exact match,
including upper and lower case and accents. I suggest a cut and paste.

From the sources, an explanation of the volume selection algorithm.
    def ret_top_vol_indx(self, url, book_title):
        # This gets the book's URL, there many volume may be present with (or not) same ISBN, same title.
        # if the book only has one volume, then we bypass ret_top_vol_indx
        #
        # the volumes are different by the publisher, edition's or re-edition's date, cover, resume, critic...
        # MY choice is based on a point system based on the site's flag
        # resume available:                     r   1pt
        # critic available:                     c   1pt         # maybe incorrect as sometimes, when a critic exists
        # series critic:                        cs  1pt         # it is distributed to all volume without indication
        # summary of novel in the book:         s   1pt
        # verified information                  v   2pt
        # same title as requested               t   5pt
        # cover available                       p   1pt
        # isbn available                        i  50pt         depending on with_isbn
        # isbn available and same as calibre      100pt         depending on with_isbn
        # the score will be increased so that the volume will be chosen to the most present publisher ... MY choice
        # in case of equality the oldest win
